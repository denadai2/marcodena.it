                <h4>Are Safer Looking Neighborhoods More Lively? A Multimodal Investigation into Urban Life</h4><p>Policy makers, urban planners, architects, sociologists, and economists are interested in creating urban areas that are both lively and safe. But are the safety and liveliness of neighborhoods independent characteristics? In this paper we explore the connection between the levels of activity and the perception of safety of neighborhoods in two major Italian cities by combining mobile phone data (as a proxy for activity or liveliness) with scores of perceived safety estimated using a Convolutional Neural Network trained on a dataset of Google Street View images scored using a crowdsourced visual perception survey.</p>

                <h4>The Death and Life of Great Italian Cities: A Mobile Phone Data Perspective</h4><p>The Death and Life of Great American Cities was written in 1961 and is now one of the most influential book in city planning. In it, Jane Jacobs proposed four conditions that promote life in a city. However, these conditions have not been empirically tested until recently.
We operationalized these conditions extracting information from Open Data, Foursquare and mobile phone data and testing them in six Italian cities.</p>
