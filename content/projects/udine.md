Summary: multi-modal public transport iOS application
Sortorder: 8


During my studies in Udine, I discovered that the movements by public transports in this city were a pain in the ass. The bus stops didn't have an understandable time table and you couldn't travel without knowing the city. Furthermore the stops in the streets were divided by the names "right side" and "left side": are they understandable enough? For this reasons I decided to create an application that could help the travellers to reach each corner of the city. Simply writing the departure point and the arrival point, the application provides the user the complete multi-modal itinerary in order to reach the final point.

The project was made for iOS 4/5/6 using [OpenTripPlanner](http://opentripplanner.com/) which was contributed also by me, the [GTFS format](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference) and [OpenStreetMap](http://opentripplanner.com/).
