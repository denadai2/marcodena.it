Summary: re-design proposal for the Coca-Cola blog
Sortorder: 4


This was a project I did during my Bachelorâ€™s degree. My web design teacher, Paolo Omero, divided the class in teams of 2-3 people who needed to create a website following all the web design theories he explained during the course. I was in team with Cristina Giachin and Cecilia Natale.
We realized an unofficial proposition for a new Coca-Cola blog which contained the history, the quotes and the news about this fantastic product.

The website is realized with WordPress, 960gs and CSS3.
