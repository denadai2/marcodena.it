[Red365](http://www.red-fire.it/) is a new multi-language website about eco-heating. The website is simple and it is provided with an automatic configurator which helps the users to select the product that most fit the customers’ necessities.

The website is realized with PHP Zend Framework, 960gs, jQuery, mySQL, [requireJS](http://requirejs.org/). We collaborated also with [MOCA Interactive](http://www.mocainteractive.com/), in order to optimize all the website for the search engines.
