[Red365](http://www.red-fire.it/) is a new multi-language website about eco-heating. The website is simple and it is provided with an automatic configurator which helps the users to select the product that most fit the customersâ€™ necessities.

The website is realized with PHP Zend Framework, 960gs, jQuery, mySQL, [requireJS](http://requirejs.org/). We collaborated also with [MOCA Interactive](http://www.mocainteractive.com/), in order to optimize all the website for the search engines.
