[Ulook](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id638768178?mt=8) is a fashion mobile application. Users can upload their own look, tag the clothes by their name and price, and share the outfit with other users. Most liked pictures will appear on the home page, and you will become popular into the community.

I developed the application, the design and the API system. The first one was made for iOS 6/7, using: [RestKit](http://restkit.org/), [CrittercismSDK](https://www.crittercism.com/), [FastImageCache](https://github.com/path/FastImageCache), [TestFlight](http://testflightapp.com/) and [Flurry](http://www.flurry.com/). The API system is built on top of PHP Zend Framework.

Update: the application was recognized as the best application in the "Community and Social" category by the "Smau Mob App Awards" that took place during the Smau 2014.
