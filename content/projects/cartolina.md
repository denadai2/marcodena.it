Summary: postcards iOS application
Sortorder: b


Cartolina is a personal project which allows you to send postcards directly from your iPhone. It allows you to take a picture of a place and send a physical postcard to your family and friends. This allows you to share real emotions, not pre-built pictures.
I developed the application, the design and the API system. The first one was made for iOS 6/7, using: [AFNetworking](https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking), [CrittercismSDK](https://www.crittercism.com/), [Foursquare-API](https://developer.foursquare.com/) and [TestFlight](http://testflightapp.com/). The API system is built with Python and [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/).
