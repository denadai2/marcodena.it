It is almost the end of 2016 and I started my Ph.D. more than one year ago. 2016 was a busy year for me, continuosly travelling travelling all over the world for conferences and new (scientific?) experiences. Thus, I want to share some of my favourite papers published this year.

If you find this list (or idea) intersting, I ask you to write your personal list of favourite papers and share it with me! I am always intersted in exploring others' scientific interests.


1. [The TimeGeo modeling framework for urban mobility without travel surveys](http://www.pnas.org/content/113/37/E5370.abstract)[^1]. This paper is the *nec plus ultra* of the urban mobility modelization through mobile phone data. It starts with a simple flow-chart that describes people's mobility, then it flies to a flexible extraction and simulation of daily trajectories. As always, Supporting Materials are painful to read :)

2. [Scaling identity connects human mobility and social interactions](http://www.pnas.org/content/113/37/E5370.abstract)[^2]. Our mobility and communication patterns are extremely connected: one influences the other. We had a glimpse of it in the past literature[^14], but this paper establishes the formal link between them. Moreover, this work allows also to approximate social fluxes from mobility and viceversa. This is great at a macroscopic scale, but what if we look at socio-demographic information or different cultures?

3. [Returners and explorers dichotomy in human mobility](http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms9166)[^3]. Power/scaling laws and macroscopic scales always look at universal behavior. What I like the most of this paper is that it looks at differences. Particularly, by looking at people's recurrent movements it finds that two well-separated mobility profiles of people emerge: returners and explorers. The formers are inclined to go to previously visited places, while the latters have a tendency to wander between a larger number of different locations. This has a great impact on spending patterns, hasn't it?

4. [To explain or to predict?](http://www.jstor.org/stable/41058949)[^4]. Have you ever wondered what are the differences between models that explains and models trying to predict future outcomes? This paper should be read by all data mining, machine learning and econometrics students!

5. [Prediction policy problems](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.p20151023)[^5]. Right after Galit's paper[^4], this is a must-read article to understand the role of predictions for policy-makers.

6. [The Atlas of Economic Complexity: Mapping Paths to Prosperity](https://www.hks.harvard.edu/centers/cid/publications/books/atlas)[^11]. This book is from 2013, but is a cristal-clear explanation of the economic complexity theory by Hidalgo *et al.*[^12]. I also suggest you [their visualizaiton](http://atlas.cid.harvard.edu/) tool if you want to understand the exports of your country. Do you want a general-purpose explanation of this? There is also a [book](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20763722-why-information-grows)!

7. [Understanding congested travel in urban areas](http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms10793)[^6]. Should everyone choose the optimal route? Should drivers try to reach Nash equilibrium in the city? Should some drivers adjust routing behaviour to achieve social good at the expense of their time? Super super enjoyable paper to read! Grande Antonio!

8. [Measuring Urban Social Diversity Using Interconnected Geo-Social Networks](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2883065)[^7]. This paper aims at distinguishing between places that bring together strangers versus those which tend to bring together friends. Something in-between socal science, urban theory and computer science. Nice!

9. [Is this scaling nonlinear?](https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.02872)[^8]. Finally! FINALLY! After some evidence of the weak systematic acceleration (deceleration) of urban life in cities[^9], here we have a clear statistical analysis against Bettencourt's work[^10]. City scientists, read it!

10. [Image-to-Image Translation with Conditional Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07004)[^13]. Mind-blowing paper that could be the future of computer science and machine learning. Just look at the image below to understand the capabilites!

The special mention, of course, goes to Jane Jacobs' [The Death and Life of Great American Cities](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30833.The_Death_and_Life_of_Great_American_Cities). Thanks to it I had the change to open my computer-scientist mind, work with Daniele Quercia, Cesar Hidalgo, and get to know a lot of people and researchers. Thanks Jane!
