I'm currently an exchange student at the Vrije University of Amsterdam, my home university being Universit√† degli studi di Trento. As a master student majoring in Computer Science, I consider that the experience of studying abroad will not only enrich my technical knowledge, but will also give me the chance to develop in an international environment, opportunity that will greatly help me in my future career.

I have been passionate about technology from an early age and my interest in Web technologies has enabled me to work on multiple projects in this area until now. However, I think the Computer Science world has many fields which are worth being explored, a recent focus of my studies being Artificial Intelligence. Big Data is unanimously accepted as one of the most difficult challenges of the moment and I strongly believe that the knowledge that I gained during my studies recommends me as a person able to solve problems that are inherent to this field.

My practical experience has contributed to my development as a flexible team player, who can easily adapt to new situations. I would eagerly like to continue learning new things in an environment that allows me to interact with the best people in my field of interest. My belief is best illustrated by [Austin Kleon](http://austinkleon.com/)'s line of thought: "I would like to find the most talented person in the room, and go stand next to him".
