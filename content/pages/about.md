I'm currently attending the University of Trento as a Computer science major but now I am in Amsterdam, in order to acquire life experience outside my home country.
I have several years work experience in the computer science field and a big passion about technology which started when I was around 15. I love the web and this is the reason why my experience is primaly focused on it. On the other hand I am a person that likes to explore, and my newly found passion is Artificial Intelligence. This field will enable me to work successfully with Big data, which concerns the future of the entire Computer science field.

During my experience I learned to be flexible, to work in heterogeneous teams, to deal with problems and avoid them. I want to continue learning by applying my acquired knowledge in an organizational enviroment and by the interaction with the diverse people I meet and who can inspire me for my professional career.
