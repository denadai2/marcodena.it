In this article I will show part of the work I've done during my Master's internship in Amsterdam. The focus of this work was finding outliers in the gas consumption of some buildings. An outlier, by definition, is an observation which deviates significantly from other observations so that it creates suspicion that it was created by different dynamics. Despite this general definition, the more appropriate way of defining
outliers is highly application-dependent, because even same scenarios may require different determinations of outliers.

In this paper, outliers are very closed related to the problem of time-series forecasting, since outliers are declared on the basis of deviations from expected (or forecast) value.

The system is composed by 2-phase process where in the first one the short-term (hourly) gas consumption is
forecast thanks to a historical time-series, and in the second phase outliers are detected on the basis of deviations from expected (or forecast) value.

In these iPython notebooks the dataset is analysed, then it is used by an Artificial Neural Network built in [pylearn2](https://github.com/lisa-lab/pylearn2).
